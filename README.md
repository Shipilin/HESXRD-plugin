A plugin for ImageJ for analysis of surface diffraction patterns.
Extracts 3D information from reciprocal space images with all necessary 
corrections for experimental geometry and Ewald sphere curvature.
Allows for creating of 2D in-plane cuts through reciprocal lattice.
Also, allows to extract intensity and structure factor information 
for crystal truncation rods in the out-of-plane direction.
